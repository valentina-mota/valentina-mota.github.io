            Biography
        </p>
        <p class="bio-text">
            I've always nurtured a passion for the intricacies of language and communication. This fascination led me to explore music through classical guitar, delve into various dance techniques and styles, and study several foreign languages. My most recent journey in the vast realm of syntax and semantics has brought me to the world of programming languages. Besides, I love the concept of an 'educational blog,' which is why I maintain a blog dedicated to popularizing ethology as a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses various domains such as the study of behavior itself, sociology, psychology, zooanthropology, and robotics. Due to its very nature, it keenly observes all aspects of living beings' activities. My enthusiasm for these subjects drives my continuous exploration and sharing of knowledge.
